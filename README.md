# Codrops tutorial: Image carousel with OGL and GSAP

**Disclaimer**: This has been developed using NodeJS `14.15.5`. I am not aware of any incompatibility issues with other versions, but to avoid any problem it is recommended to switch to version `14.15.5` using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

```shell
$ nvm use
```
___

## Setup
```shell
$ yarn install
```
## Start development server
```shell
$ yarn dev
```

Then the development server will start at `http://localhost:1234`

## Build package
```shell
$ yarn dev
```
